## Threat Modeling
Here are a few examples:

1. Driving a Car
    - What do I want to Protect?
        Possible assets:
        - My self
        - My passengers
        - My car
    - Who/What do I want to protect them from?
        - Other drivers
        - Animals
        - Structural Integrity of Infrastructure
        - Driver falling asleep
    - How likely will I need to protect against it?
        - How good are other drivers in the area?
        - How often do animals cross the road in this area? At what time of day?
        - Does that bridge look like it can handle the weight of my car? Is the road about to fall off that cliff?
        - How awake am I?
    - How bad are the consequences if I fail?
        - Do I have car insurance if the car is totaled?
        - Death
        - Do all my passengers and myself have health insurance if we are injured?
    - How much trouble am I willing to go through to prevent these consequences?
        - Am I willing to wear a seat belt and require my passengers to as well?
        - Can I afford to buy cars with the best safety ratings?
        - Am I willing to drive the speed limit and follow traffic laws?
        - Am I willing to delay a trip to ensure I am awake and sober enough to drive?
